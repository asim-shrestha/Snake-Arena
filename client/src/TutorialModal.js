			<h5>Intro</h5>
			<p>
				The following is a quick tutorial to get you started with how to use this web app!
				Feel free to close this if you are already familiar.
				The site consists of two pages which can be navigated through the top right buttons.
			</p>
			<h5>The Arena</h5>
			<p>
				The first page is the game / home page where the game is played.
				The game is both singleplayer and multiplayer. In both settings, you are trying to survive the longest.
				The score on the right of the board represents the snake's hunger. Once a snake's hunger reaches 0, it dies. There are a number of snakes you can pick from.
				A random snake, a hungry snake that moves to the closest food, a player controlled snake that is moved with the arrow keys, and a smart snake.
				Finally, you can tweak game settings at the bottom of the page.
				NOTE: For clarity, the player snake is coloured red. Also, settings cannot be tweaked in game.
			</p>
			<h5>The Smart Snake</h5>
			<p>
				The smart snake is the coolest of the bunch and you can tweak exactly how the snake's "brain" operates.
				This is done through editing the weight value options that pop up when you select the snake.
				The higher the weight, the more the snake will prioritize moves that either provide food, provide greater free space, or avoids other snakes.
			</p>
			<h5>Leaderboards</h5>
			<p>
				The leaderboard page shows the stats of PLAYER controlled snakes.
				Stats are tied to what name is provided for PLAYER controlled snakes in game and is not tied to any account.
				Play some games against the AI yourself to get on the leaderboard!
